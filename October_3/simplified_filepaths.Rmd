Recap from simplified_filepathsc.R file:

```{r}
#Normally to import a data set, you would need to enter the entire file path
#or you would need to ensure the file is in the same folder as your script

#for me this filepath looks like this
getwd()
example_data <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/Documents/R_Scripts/Bates_Lab_Resources/Intro_Materials/example.csv")

#Now when collaborating with people, this gets annoying because in order to import
#this data yourself, you will have to update the filepath

#To make it easier, open the project. This will set the working directory to the
#location of the R Project.
#Once I have the project open I only have to specify the path relative to the projects 
#location, which means it will be the same for everyone who has downloaded 
#the repo
example_data_2 <- read.csv("Intro_Materials/example.csv")

#This worked in the simplified_filepaths.R file, which is in the same folder as this .Rmd file, because the .R file used location of the R Project as the working directory. .Rmd files are different and take the location of the .Rmd file you are in to set the working directory.
getwd()

#This is fine if your files are in the same folder as the script, but what if we wanted to load something in a folder outside of the one where this .Rmd script is? 
#For instance, the community_data.csv in the Permutation_Tests folder?
#You could re-specify the working directory which would have to be re-specified for every text chunk
#or you could add the file directory in full, but as discussed above, this does not allow for easy collaboration


#To get around this I can use the here package to replace the file name. This packages use the location of the R Project as the start of the working directory, so you only have to specify the file location in relation to the R Project
#First need to load the package here

install.packages("here") #run if you have never installed this package before
library(here) #you will need to load this package for every session

#then every place where I need to specify a filepath I just replace with 
# here("folders from project location", "file name")

example_data_3 <- read.csv(here("Permutation_Tests", "community_data.csv"))

#this is how I load all my data and even specify where to save figures or cleaned datafiles. 
#occationally a package I load after the here package will mask some aspects and you will get an error. To avoid this I often specify which package the here function is coming from

example_data_4 <- read.csv(here::here("Permutation_Tests", "community_data.csv")) #the here::here specifies that we are using the here function from the here package, so there are no confusions


```
